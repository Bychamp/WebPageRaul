2nd Practice
Description of the work:
The 2nd practice was meant for us to work and create a new webiste in HTML being able to use the CSS for our styles.
This project had an objective which was for us to learn to create this new website with some specific rules that the teacher gave us
Problems:
It was quite hard to start the website, as I didn't even know how to start. What topic should I talk about, or how should I start my home.
Then little by little my webpage started to look more and more like a webpage. But I had to afront another proble which was that the images couldn't stand next to my other images.
And after sometime trying some different things so that it could work, I finally managed to put some images next to another and I finally didn't have any more problems rather than spending a lot of time doing the webpage
I also had some problems with Git at first, as I didn't really understand how to use it at first, but after some tiem trying things out and looking how to use it, 
I managed to solve it
Conclusions:
This project was really interesting and I really learned a lot about how to create a webpage with html and css tho it took me some more time than expected.
I also learned a lot about Git, and Git hub and I learned how useful it is
